    "# ðŸ’¡ What's new in txtai 9.0\n",
    "\n",
    "[txtai](https://github.com/neuml/txtai) is an all-in-one AI framework for semantic search, LLM orchestration and language model workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 9.0 release adds first class support for sparse vector models (i.e. [SPLADE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_sparse_retrieval)), late interaction models (i.e. [ColBERT](https://huggingface.co/colbert-ir/colbertv2.0)), fixed dimensional encoding (i.e. [MUVERA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19504)) and reranking pipelines âœ¨ \n",
    "\n",
    "The embeddings framework was overhauled to seamlessly support both sparse and dense vector models. Previously, sparse vector support was limited to keyword/term indexes. Now learned sparse retrieval models such as SPLADE are supported. These models can help improve the accuracy of retrieval/search operations, which also improves RAG and Agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support for late interaction models, such as ColBERT, were also added to the embeddings framework. Unlike traditional vector models that pool outputs into single vector outputs, late interaction models produce multiple vectors. These models are paired with the MUVERA algorithm to transform multiple vectors into fixed dimensional single vectors for search.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are quickly converging to produce similar outputs for similar inputs and becoming standard commodities. The retrieval or context layer makes or breaks projects. This is known as putting the R in RAG!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standard upgrade disclaimer below**\n",
    "\n",
    "While everything is backwards compatible, it's prudent to backup production indexes before upgrading and test before deploying."

    "# Sparse vector indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "The first major change added with this release is `learned sparse retrieval` (aka sparse vector indexes) models. This effort was multi-faceted in that it required both changes to how vectors were generated as well as how they are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "`txtai` uses approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search for it's vector search operations. The default library is [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss). There is support for other libraries but in all cases the existing ANN backends only supported dense (i.e. NumPy) vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "There aren't many options out there for sparse ANN search that supports `txtai` requirements, so IVFSparse was introduced. IVFSparse is an Inverted file (IVF) index with flat vector file storage and sparse array support. There is also support for storing sparse vectors in Postgres via [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector).\n",

    "\n",
    "Late interaction models encode data into multi-vector outputs. In other words, multiple input tokens map to multiple output vectors. Then at search time, the maximum similarity algorithm is used to find the best matches between the corpus and a query. This algorithm has achieved excellent results on retrieval benchmarks such as [MTEB](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb).\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of this approach is that it produces multiple vectors as opposed a single vector for each input. For example, if a text element tokenizes to many input tokens, there will be many output vectors vs a single one as with standard pooled vector approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with the 9.0 release, late interaction models are supported with embeddings instances. Late interaction vectors will be transformed into fixed dimensional vectors using the MUVERA algorithm. See below. "
